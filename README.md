# Python-Cloudera-Healthcare-Challenge
The Cloudera Data Science Challenge is a rigorous competition in which candidates must provide a solution to a real-world big data problem that surpasses a benchmark specified by some of the world's elite data scientists.

# PROBLEM SUMMARY:
The Challenge was divided into the following three parts, each of which had specific requirements that pertained to identifying anomalous entities in different aspects of the Medicare system:

Part 1: Identify providers that overcharge for certain procedures or regions where procedures are too expensive.
Part 1A: Highest Cost Variation
Part 1B: Highest-Cost Claims by Provider Parts 1C: Highest-Cost Claims by Region
Part 1D: Highest Number of Procedures and Largest Differences between Claims and Reimbursements

Part 2: Identify the three providers that are least similar to other providers and the three regions that are least similar to other regions.
Part 2A: Providers Least Like Others Part 2B: Regions Least Like Others

Part 3: Identify 10,000 Medicare patients who are involved in anomalous activities.
